# Custom QDoubleSpinBox with Precision Control
## Overview

This project provides a custom implementation of the QSpinBox widget from the Qt framework, allowing you to control the number of decimal places displayed. The custom QSpinBox ensures that only the specified number of decimal places are shown, providing a more precise and user-friendly interface for applications that require fine-grained numerical input.

## Features
- Precision Control: Define the number of decimal places to be displayed.
- Custom Behavior: Override default behavior to enforce precision constraints.
- Easy Integration: Simple to integrate into existing Qt-based projects.
